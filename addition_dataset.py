def make_addition_expressions(N, max_operand_digits=2, seed=1):
    '''Generates arithmetic expressions involving the addition operator and two `max_operand_digits` digit operands.
    By default, each operand is a 2 digits long positive integer, so the largest sum that can be included is
    99+99=198.

    Includes the special characters:
    - '.' to indicate the end of an expression has been reached. int code = 12.
    - '#' to pad an expression so that all expressions have the same length in chars. int code = 13.

    This function is provided to you. You should not need to modify it.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    N: int.
        Number of expressions to generate.
    max_operand_digits: int.
        Maximum number of digits of each positive integer operand.
        For example if max_operand_digits=1, 9+1=10 would be possible, but not 90+1=91.
    seed: int.
        Random seed that controls the reproducability of generated expressions.

    Returns:
    --------
    Python list of list of chars (str).
        The fixed-length addition expressions. Each expression represented as a list of chars.
        For example: 47+51=98 is represented as: ['4', '7', '+', '5', '1', '=', '9', '8', '.', '#']
    Dictionary mapping str → int.
        Maps each char to its position in the vocabulary.
