# 🔁 Transformers
Implements a GPT-style Transformer model from scratch using our modular deep learning library, [![DeepNeuralLib](https://img.shields.io/badge/Repo-DeepNeuralLib-blue?logo=github)](https://github.com/treytuscai/DeepNeuralLib). Trains small transformers to perform arithmetic tasks and larger ones to generate Shakespearean text, showcasing attention mechanisms and positional encoding.
